# project
This is an Application project to get a job in [DOONAMIS ->](https://www.doonamis.es/proyectos/)

They asked me to implement MVVM architecture using Riverpod to get access to an API in order to see the best rated TV-series

I've used Provider instead and implemented an offline version with an non SQL database (HIVE) & HTTP lib also create a res folder to access all the resource like color, dimention & string from the single place only.

I have also integrate multilanguage support for the flutter app how to implemwnt this in flutter.
